# Geode Mod Comments

This mod adds a **comment section** to mod popups in Geode Loader UI, allowing users to leave their thoughts to mod directly in the UI. 

## Features include:  

- **Post, edit, and delete** comments (with GD Account verification).  
- **Markdown support** (format text with bold, italic, links, etc)
- **Multiline input**
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quick navigation (F5 to refresh, Enter to send, Shift to fast delete, etc.).  

**Note:** Requires a **GD account**. (Uses [Argon](https://github.com/globedgd/argon) for authenticating)

*This is open v2 beta. I would be happy to any feedback.*</c>
